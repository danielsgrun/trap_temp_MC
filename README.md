# trap_temp_MC

A set of functions and example applications of classical Canonical-ensemble Monte-Carlo simulations of atoms trapped in an optical-dipole trap.

Example includes:

  i. the option of comparing a release-and-recapture simulation with experimental measurements for the extraction of ensemble temperatures of the atoms in the trap.

 ii. an option of simulating the system's behavior (for a given temperature) of trap frequency measurements via release-and-recapture (see example videos).

iii. possibility to simulate the distribution of trap frequencies of the ensemble for different temperatures.
